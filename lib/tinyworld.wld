Limbo~
   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.

which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  There are no doors out.  Clearly

Memorarium~
   When Memo has nothing better to do, he tries to relax here. It's a cosy
little place, with a couple of great big armchairs drawn up around a table
with a few half empty bottles on it while at the other end, barely visible
behind a partly drawn curtain is an unmade bed. Covering the entire of one
wall are dozens of shelves weighed down by hundreds of dusty books. On the
wall opposite it is a picture and a plaque below it. Sadly, you can't seem
to find a way out.

The Office~
  You see a large messy desk, papers scattered about, photos of second-rate
singers, dancers, and low-life comedians cover the wall behind the desk.  It
is here that the manager of the Club Safari, affectionately known south of

Club Safari~
   You hear dance music in the air, it makes you want to get loose
and dance your head off.  The dancefloor is brought to life with
dancing light that ricochets of the surrounding mirrors. You are in
the Club lounge, get comfortable, and let your problems drift away.
There is a long bar east of here, stocked with the finest liquors.

The Wheel Room~
   This is room where you can play The Big Wheel, a very simple,
but possibly lucrative, game.  To learn how to play just type

rules~
The Big Wheel is a large spinning wheel, much like the one you may have
seen on that idiotic TV show, Wheel of Fortune.  There are 101 numbers,
1 to 101, on the wheel.  You can bet anywhere from 1 to 10,000 coins on
any of the numbers.  The payoff is 100 times your bet, giving the house
a VERY small edge.  The command syntax is BET <amount> on <number>.
What could be simpler?

rules~
This is a VERY simple version of blackjack.  No doubling-down, no split
hands, etc.  The two commands you'll need are BET and CARD.  If you don't
CARD, you automatically stand.  The bet limit is 100,000 coins.  To make
a bet, type BET <amount>.  PAY ATTENTION TO THE DEALER.  To make up for
the lack of features, we payoff 2-1 on blackjacks, instantly.  Those of
you who can handle 4th grade arithmetic should be able to compute the
advantage this gives you.

You can find how how much it costs to have him tinker by using
the COST command.  You can BUY his services if you find the price
reasonable.  Examples:

       cost sword hit
       buy  sword dam

The changes will not survive rent.  After all, it's so cheap.

ready to offer you food and drink.  While most of the patrons are halfling
locals, you spy an occasional human or two.  As you listen more closely
to the conversations that fill the inn, you hear the tales of great and
seasoned adventurers as well as the usual gossip.  You feel as if you've
found your second home in the Green Dragon.  You see a stairway leading
upwards.

and a very large blast crater. Obviously someone or something important
was once housed here. A shreeking howl chills your blood.

A tall dwelling~
     This seems to be the tallest structure remaining in the city. At
one time this could have been an inn of some sort, but now it's just
a mess. The back wall as been completely knocked down revealing an
entrance into another building through yet another collapsed wall.
Between the two buildings are a few blast craters and boulders. An old
set of wooden steps leads up to a creaking second floor.

with the back wall missing, it could hold many more. Looking around you
find broken shelves and workbenches with various vials and pouches spilling
contents all across the floor. This was possibly the magic shop of the
city. The doorway to the east is blocked, making the only exit back west.

steamy water still wells up from a hole in the floor. Obviously there
is a hot spring located under the city (making the decision to put
a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water
yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
of floating in there. The west wall has collapsed revealing another

stunning domed temple once housed the city's worshipers en masse.
Unfortunately, it succumed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desecrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tounge.

You are dangling on the slippery sides of the old well leading down and up.

You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the

the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.

is beautifully carven with small elves as main issue of sculpture.

The Sitting room of Naris~
You are standing in the middle of a really comfortable place. The walls are
decorated with paintings of smiling Kings and Queens. The most attractive
picture is one of a Prince in shiny armour. By one of the walls there is an
old arm-chair. The only exit is through the aspenwood door to the east.

The Kitchen of Naris~
This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of
rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable. The sound
makes you feel the agony of HUNGER. The only visible exit is south to the

up OR down. It's just a seemingly insurmountable climb, either way. Up is the
bedroom of Redferne, and Down leads to the Southern end of the hall.

Redferne's Bedroom~
This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic evening.
A large fireplace adourns the east wall, and sizzling away is the wood that
is ablaze within. The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great
room. This stretches at least 140 square feet, so can you imagine the BED?
A large staircase leads down to the hall. A couple of doors open up to a
broad balcony to the south.

The Chain where it's too windy~
Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down
from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

Besides it could cost you your life. Look down and you'll see why.

The Chain~
As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*.
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

        above, grabbing your body, that begins to
        pulse with coloured lights from inside.
        Your head seems to be filled with deamons
        from another plane as your body dissolves
        to the elements of time and space itself.
        Suddenly a silent explosion of lights snaps
        you back to reality. You feel slightly 
        different.

Torture chamber~
  You are in an ill lit chamber. Intruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

metalic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

Library of Loftwick~
There are literally hundreds of books lying here. They are surprisingly
in good condition. After a brief search of the texts you learn that
Loftwick was not only the founder of this city but was also the brother
of Redferne the Grand Knight of Paladins. Loftwick left Midgaard after
a bitter dispute with Redferne. He used vile magics in pursuit of
immortality. Through his magics he met a race called the GITHYANKI that
offered to help him in exchange for a haven on this plane that they
could raid Midgaard from. Loftwick agreed but he didn't count on the
Githyanki turning his city into a realm of the living dead and a truly
EVIL place.

The Bedchamber~
This is the bedroom of Loftwick.  A huge canopy bed rests in the middle of the
floor.  A Picture of the God Karn is on the wall.  You begin to see where
Loftwick got the power of Darkness from.  The Bed appears to have been slept
in only moments ago.  You sense a great anger as it becomes apparent
that for Karn to grant Loftwicks request, Loftwick had to murder his own wife
to show dedication to Karn.

This the Gift Shop.  You can buy things here.  Don't mess with the
owner, however.  The Gift Shop needs a good advertising agency to

The Catacombs~
You are walking through the dark tunnel of the moldy catacombs.  The walls
are covered with all sorts of fungi and other strange things you can't even
identify.  The room is dimly illuminated by torches hanging on the walls,
and you can see that the tunnel continues to the east where it ends at a
large silver door covered with glowing golden runes.

The Crypt of Lady Emathia~
You have entered a huge and magnificent chamber.  The walls are decorated
with beautiful tapestries and the entire room is filled with beautiful
jewels and statues.  In the center of the room is a huge sarcophagus made
of pure, shiny silver, totally covered with golden runes that glow brightly
against the silver background.  The sarcophagus is closed, and does not look
like it has been opened in centuries.

structure, and now it feels as if it is falling apart.  The Second floor

Ruins of the Ancient Temple~
You are walking through what was once a great temple.  Many tapestries
describing horrible creatures coming and destroying the world hang on the
walls. In the center of the temple there is a large dias, and behind it an
altar made of a silvery-white material.  Hanging over the altar is a large
ebony statue of a horrible fiend holding the head of a human child in one hand,
and a huge sword in the other.  The black ebony sword seems to be surrounded by
a dim red glow that illuminates the dark temple.

glow as well.  Obviously, whatever diety was worshiped in this temple is aware
that you are here, and is probably not very happy about it, so you'd better

It is made of a glowing bright colored metal, probably silver or platinum.

there is no point staying in this pit much longer, and there is no way to
reach the dark stairway that brought you here, your only option is to enter

above you in the dark skies, and many other undead fiends walk the dark
ground.

prevents you from continuing west, so the only other exit would be to follow
the river to the south, where you notice a small cave.

The Abyss~
The flat, pitch-black plane of ebony stone of the Abyss seems to comtinue on
as far as you can see.  For some strange reason, the horrible demons that fly
in the dark skies seem to watch over you, but not attack.  The black river
blocks your passage south, and another magical force blocks your way north.
As you follow the river to the south, you see the cave getting closer and
closer.

Again, a small cave emerges out of the flat surface of the Abyss.  This one
seems very small, as it probably lairs a smaller beast.  You can see two
blazing red eyes glaring at you from the darkness of the cave.

abominations of what were once frogs, toads, fish, rabbits and other
creatures you can't even identify.  Whoever this lab does belong to,
must be a cruel and evil sorcerer, or perhaps, considering the state
of this place, an undead lich!

dancing around you.  When you listen closely, you hear that they seem to be
chanting a prayer or some sort, as if they were about to sacrifice you to some
evil diety, perhaps the one worshiped in the temple that brought you to this
awful place.  Looking down, again you see the black ground of yet another
level of the Abyss.

clouds and red swirls of gasses.  More rivers cover this level as they did the
first one.  As you look up, you realize that the demons ar enearly upon you,
and will probably attack at any minute.

figures fly around you, as if in some sort of ritual, but, like the flying
demons, they do not attack.  It is a very unnerving experience.  Suddenly, the
specteral demons begin to scream very loudly, an ear-shattering cry that
pierces your very soul.  Then, they all charge twards you.  Right before you
are sure they will tear you apart, they stop.  Then they all turn a misty
white, and dissapear.  Everything is silent, and even more unnerving than when
the ghosts were around.

red gasses in the dark skies.  And after all the time in the Abyss, the flying
demons finally fly down to attack you.  You can see no more staircases in any
direction you look, and that portal may have been your only way out.  Now all
you can do is continue on into the Pit of the Abyss.

The Pit of the Abyss~
The floor here is very smooth, which is all you can tell, since it is
pitch-black and you can't see a thing.  You hear alot of chanting all around
you, and have a bad feeling that this is where the most horrible fiends in the
Abyss dwell, and where sacrifices like yourself are brought by their
worshipers.  As you feel around, you find exits to the east and south.

The Ancient Temple~
This temple looks as if it were over a million years old.  It is filled with
statues of different fiends, and other forms of undead that come here to
worship their diety.  In the center you see the same statue you saw in the
temple back in Midgaard.  Then, you realize that this is no statue.  It is,
however, the most feared fiend in all of the Abyss, and a sight no mortal eyes
should see.  The fiend stands before a large golden door, probably the way out
of this Abyss.

The Portal~
This is another portal, far larger that the other one, with a small sign next
to it that reads: "To the Upper World."  This is obviously the gateway that
leads back to Midgaard, where mortals like yourself belong.

The Secret Chamber~
You have entered a very small and very dark chamber, which seems to be
some sort of hide-out.  The walls and floor are very smooth, and made of
some strange black stone that absorbs all your light.  The only exit is
north, back the way you came.

A Smelly Old Room~
    In the center of the room is a large pentagram, covered in what appears
to be bloodstains and torn flesh.  My god! What has happened in this room?
The sides of the walls have blotches of blood all over them.  Other than the
the bloodstains and the pentagram on the floor there is nothing else that
makes this room unique.  In the center of the pentagram is a small cube.
This cube may hold some key to the future of what has happened in this room.
To the North and the East are doors which are closed but not locked.  The
door handles are coverd with blood much like the floor is.  Suddenly, crys
of death echo throughout the room. You shiver all over. There are no exits
out of this room except those that continue on to unknown ventures.

Entrance to the Realm of Music~
You have entered a very strange place.  You are floating in what seems to
be an endless maze of blue clouds.  Music can be heard playing from all
directions.  From the east, you can hear simple, repetative music played
by small ensembles.  From the west, you hear several tunes playing, but all
are very similar.  From the south, you hear horrible noise, sounding like
many different and unusual melodies playing at once.  From above, however,
you hear music more beautiful than anything you have ever heard before.

Outside a Cave~
You are standing outside the narrow entrance to a dark cave.  A set of
tracks, like those for a mine car, end at the very entrance to the cave.
There is no noise coming from inside the cave, and the mines have probably
been abandoned for years.
