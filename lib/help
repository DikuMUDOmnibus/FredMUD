This MUD is based on DikuMUD, but has been changed in many ways:

1. There are no classes.  All players are created equal.
2. When you advance, you get practices, which can be used to learn
   skills, spells, or to improve your stats.  The two locations to
   know for this are the Guild and the Fitness Center.  Both are
   south of the west end of Main St.
3. It is probably wise to practice wisdom and constitution at first,
   since these stats affect how fast you can grow.
4. You can get to level 1000 by earning experience in the usual MUD
   way.  After that things change.  By the time you get to level
   1000 you'll probably know all about it.
5. Look over the output of the commands COMMANDS and SPELLINFO.
6. CAUTION: The commands NOSUMMON and NORELOCATE have been added to
   protect you from predatory high level characters.  Use them!
7. There are no gods on this MUD (except Rocko).
