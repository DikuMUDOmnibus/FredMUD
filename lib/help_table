high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.
#

Then you wear it.  Then you set it to a channel (1-99),
using the CHANNEL command.  Then you TALK in it.
For example:

     wear radio
     channel 1
     talk Hello, world.

Typing 'talk' with no arguments, lists the recent talks.  This is called
'talk history' and was Slug's idea.  Slug has too many ideas.

summoning you.  It is a toggle.
#

#
DETONATE BOMB
Usage: DETONATE BOMB TICKS

This command sets the fuse on a bomb to go off in a specified
number of ticks.  The bomb must be held in your inventory, so
there is a great danger that it will damage an unskilled
detonator.  It is wise to make TICKS at least 2.  It also wise
to drop the bomb or try to give it to someone else after it has
been ignited.  Note: unskilled detonators may get the timing a
little wrong...
#
VERYBRIEF
Usage: VERYBRIEF

#
XYZZY

default your recall room is the Temple of Midgaard.  XYZZY is a
level 30 command.

#
MR
Your MR (or Magic Resistance) is your ability to resist offensive
spells.  For damage spells it is the percentage of damage deflected.
So if your MR is 25, the damage done by an offensive spell will be
reduced by 25%.  For spells like drain life, things are different.
In that case MR reduces the amount of hp taken by 0.5%, per unit of
MR.
#
PRIME ANTIPRIME

A PRIME item is one that cannot be used by low level (62 or less)
players.  An ANTIPRIME item is one that cannot be used by high

are subject to change.

#
KERPLUNK
A fascinating new spell which can raise the potency of other high
level spells when used in moderation, or in excess.  Certain colors
associated with this spell are different than others.  No two colors
are alike, unless they are identical.  When used in the Temple, the
chances of success are greater or equal to the chances for success
in other areas.  The mana cost will vary as the arctangent of the
move points of the target, plus a moderately large constant factor,
minus 10.

    Then when you type 'kf', the game executes the command 'kill fido'.
  Typing 'alias' by itself lists your aliases.
  Typing 'alias bob' will show you what, if anything, 'bob' means as an
    alias.
  
  Slug did alias first.  This is a remake.
